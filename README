Test project.
To run application please open target directory and run "java -jar Gas_And_Water_Usage_Monitoring-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" command.
For easier testing I recommend to use swagger by the following url "http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html".
I used single class for all measurements it makes application flexible, if you need to add new type of measurement like electricity or any other you
need only to change data in DB, no recompilation of application will be required, the only limitation is that measurement must be pf double type, this
can be alse improved with help of UI, I can explain that during interview.
